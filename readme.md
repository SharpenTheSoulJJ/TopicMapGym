TopicMapGym Guide
Welcome to our TopicMapGym - your ultimate online destination for exploring mainstream and popular gym exercises across various categories including glutes, legs, chest and triceps, back and biceps, arms, stomach, cardio, and yoga. Our goal is to provide a structured, easily navigable platform where fitness enthusiasts can quickly find and learn about different exercises, understand the correct techniques, and get insights into which muscles are being targeted.

Features
Exercise Categories: Detailed tabs for each muscle group and exercise type, making it easy to find what you're looking for.
Interactive Exercise Buttons: Clickable buttons that reveal detailed images demonstrating the correct form and technique for each exercise.
Image Navigation: Ability to navigate forwards and backwards through exercise images to view different steps or techniques.
Adaptive Design: Two separate CSS files ensure optimal viewing and navigation experience on both laptops and phones.
Donate Button: Contribute to the maintenance and enhancement of the site, helping us to keep providing valuable fitness resources.
How It Works
The website is built with simplicity and ease of use in mind. It's powered by basic web technologies - HTML (index.html), CSS (style.css for desktop and mobile), and JavaScript (script.js). The exercises are organized into tabs corresponding to different body parts and types of exercises. Each tab contains buttons for each exercise. Clicking on a button shows images that illustrate how to perform the exercise, including the muscles involved.

Navigating the Site
Select the tab corresponding to the muscle group or type of exercise you're interested in. Click on the exercise buttons to view the instructional images. You can navigate through the images to see different phases of the exercise or various exercises within the selected category.

Adding New Exercises
To add new exercises or images, replace the old images in the images folder following the naming convention tab_exercise_number, e.g., tab1_exercise1_1.png, corresponding to the button's position in the grid. If adding new images beyond the existing ones, update the script.js file to accommodate the new images. This involves adjusting the function that counts the last image to ensure proper navigation stops.
